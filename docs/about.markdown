I am a researcher in the field of robot control, passionate about developing novel control strategies for intuitive human-robot collaboration. My expertise is in system dynamics, control, optimization, cooperative robot manipulation, teleoperation, and haptics. I am a goal-oriented, methodical person who gets things done and continuously seeks to expand and improve my knowledge and skill set.
Currently, my focus is on understanding how humans collaborate and haptically interact with the environment and using this knowledge to enable the decision-making of robots in human-robot physical interaction. Envisioned applications are in healthcare, primarily in exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation and intelligent prosthesis. I am conducting this research as a Postdoctoral fellow, jointly affiliated with Stanford University and the Technical University of Munich.

I am a recipient of the award for the best PhD in Electrical Engineering from Bund der Freunde der Technischen Universität München and of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship funded by the European Commission.
